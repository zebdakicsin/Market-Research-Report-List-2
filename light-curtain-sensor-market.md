<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Light Curtain Sensor Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Reflective Light Curtain Sensors</li><li>Diffuse Light Curtain Sensors</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Reflective light curtain sensors are a type of light curtain sensor that consist of a sender and receiver unit placed opposite to each other. They emit infrared light beams, and when an object interrupts the beams, an alert is raised. Diffuse light curtain sensors, on the other hand, consist of a sender and receiver unit placed adjacent to each other. They emit light beams at a certain angle, and when an object comes into the proximity of the sensor, the light is reflected back to the receiver unit, triggering an alert.</p></p>
