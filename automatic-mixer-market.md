<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Automatic Mixer Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Gating</li><li>Gain Sharing</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Automatic Mixers are audio devices used in sound systems to manage multiple audio inputs. Gating is a type of market that automatically controls which microphone is active based on the level of sound captured. It activates the microphone when the sound exceeds a certain threshold and deactivates it when the sound level falls below.</p><p>Gain sharing, on the other hand, is a market where the total gain or volume level of all active microphones is automatically adjusted to avoid distortion or inconsistency. It redistributes the gain among the microphones to maintain a balanced and consistent audio output.</p></p>
