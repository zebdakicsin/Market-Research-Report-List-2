<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Flame Retardant Elastomer Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Soft Segment Elastomers</li><li>Hard Segment Elastomer</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Flame retardant elastomer market is categorized into two types: soft segment elastomers and hard segment elastomers. Soft segment elastomers refer to polymers with flexible chains that have a low Tg (glass transition temperature), making them highly elastic and exhibiting excellent rubber-like properties. On the other hand, hard segment elastomers have rigid segments incorporated into their polymer structure, resulting in a higher Tg and reduced flexibility. Both types are used in various industries where flame retardant properties are required to ensure safety.</p></p>
